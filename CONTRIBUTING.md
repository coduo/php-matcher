# A quick guide to contribute to the project:

## Installing the dev environment

1.  Fork the repo
2.  Clone the repo to local
3.  Install dependencies: `composer update` (this assumes you have 'composer' aliased to wherever your composer.phar lives)
4.  Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great to know that you have a clean slate:
    `./bin/phpunit`

## Coding Standards

Try use similar coding standards to what you see in the project to keep things clear to the contributors. If you're unsure, it's always a safe bet to fall-back to the PSR standards.
